## What is Usage Based Insurance?
Usage-Based Insurance, referred to as pay-per-mile, pay-as-you-drive, or pay-as-you-go, is
a type of auto insurance that, depending on the specific insurerâ€™s program, can measure how far
and how a driver drive their vehicle.

### How does Usage-Based Insurance work?
This type of insurance works by having a device installed on a vehicle (OBD II) where it collects
informations such as mileage, vehicle speed, engine rpm, etc.
